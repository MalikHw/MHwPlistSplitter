### MHwPlistSplitter
converts .plist and .png's to Readable PNG's so you can edit or peek urself!

***If you're looking to **merge** the sprites, i won't do the code cuz i wrote this one in 2 hours lol, so just Go to [GDColon's gdsplitter](https://gdcolon.com/gdsplitter/) website, then "Merge Sprites", put all of your pictures there (Make sure to select "Hd" or "uhd" if ur right)***
